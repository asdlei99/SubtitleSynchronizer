# SubtitleSynchronizer
Helps to manually synchronize a subtitle file (.SRT) for a video.
The program takes in a path to a .srt file and a time in milliseconds. It will then add the given time to every time field in the subtitle track.
This allows the user to manually synchronize the .srt file when the subtitles appear too late or too soon.
